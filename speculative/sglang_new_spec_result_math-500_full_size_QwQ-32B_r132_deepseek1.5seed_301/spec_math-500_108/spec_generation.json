Compute $k.$\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<｜Assistant｜><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about an ellipse and a circle tangent to it at two points on the x-axis. The ellipse equation is given as kx² + y² = 1, where k > 1. The foci are F₁ and F₂, and there's a circle passing through both foci and tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. I need to find the value of k. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of ellipses and circles.\n\nFirst, I remember that the standard form of an ellipse is (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1, where a > b for a horizontal ellipse. Comparing this to the given equation kx² + y² = 1, I can rewrite it as (x²)/(1/k) + (y²)/1 = 1. So, in standard form, the major axis is along the y-axis because the denominator under y² is 1, which is larger than 1/k since k > 1. Wait, is that right? Let me think.\n\nIf k > 1, then 1/k < 1. So, the major axis is along the y-axis, and the minor axis is along the x-axis. That means the semi-minor axis is sqrt(1/k) and the semi-major axis is 1. Okay, so the ellipse is taller than it is wide. Now, the foci of an ellipse are located at a distance of c from the center along the major axis, where c² = a² - b². Here, a is the semi-major axis, which is 1, and b is the semi-minor axis, which is sqrt(1/k). So, c² = 1 - (1/k). Therefore, c = sqrt(1 - 1/k). So, the foci F₁ and F₂ are located at (0, c) and (0, -c) on the y-axis.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions a circle that passes through F₁ and F₂ and is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. Hmm, so the circle is tangent to the ellipse on the x-axis. That probably means the circle touches the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. Also, since the circle passes through the foci, which are on the y-axis, the circle must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, the circle's center must lie on the y-axis. Let's denote the center of the circle as (0, h), and its radius as r. Since the circle passes through F₁ and F₂, which are at (0, c) and (0, -c), the distance from the center (0, h) to each focus is equal to the radius. So, the distance from (0, h) to (0, c) is |h - c| = r, and similarly, the distance to (0, -c) is |h + c| = r. Therefore, we have |h - c| = |h + c| = r.\n\nWait, but that can only happen if h - c = h + c, which would imply -c = c, which is only possible if c = 0, but c = sqrt(1 - 1/k), which is positive since k > 1. So, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe h - c = -(h + c). So, h - c = -h - c. Then, 2h = 0, so h = 0. So, the center of the circle is at (0, 0). Therefore, the circle has radius equal to the distance from (0,0) to (0, c), which is c. So, the radius is c.\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is x² + y² = c². But c² is 1 - 1/k, so the circle's equation is x² + y² = 1 - 1/k.\n\nNow, this circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. So, let's find the points of tangency. Since the circle is tangent to the ellipse on the x-axis, those points must satisfy both the ellipse and the circle equations.\n\nLet me write down the equations:\n\n1. Ellipse: kx² + y² = 1\n2. Circle: x² + y² = 1 - 1/k\n\nSince the circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis, those points must satisfy both equations and have the same y-coordinate, which should be zero because they are on the x-axis.\n\nSo, substituting y = 0 into both equations:\n\nFor the ellipse: kx² = 1 => x² = 1/k => x = ±1/√k\n\nFor the circle: x² = 1 - 1/k => x = ±sqrt(1 - 1/k)\n\nTherefore, since these points are the same (the points of tangency), their x-coordinates must be equal. So, we have:\n\n1/√k = sqrt(1 - 1/k)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(1/√k)² = (sqrt(1 - 1/k))²\n1/k = 1 - 1/k\n\nNow, let's solve for k:\n\n1/k + 1/k = 1\n2/k = 1\nk = 2\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nSo, if k = 2, then the ellipse equation becomes 2x² + y² = 1, which is a standard ellipse with semi-major axis 1 along y and semi-minor axis sqrt(1/2) along x. The foci are at (0, c) and (0, -c) where c = sqrt(1 - 1/2) = sqrt(1/2) = 1/√2. The circle passing through these foci is x² + y² = (1/√2)² = 1/2. The circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. Let's verify that.\n\nAt the points of tangency, y = 0. For the ellipse, 2x² = 1 => x = ±√(1/2)/1 = ±1/√2. Wait, but the circle equation x² + 0 = 1/2, so x = ±√(1/2) = ±1/√2. So, yes, the points are (±1/√2, 0). So that matches. So, the points are the same, so that works. \n\nBut let me think again: the circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. So, the circle is above and below the ellipse, but in this case, the circle is centered at (0,0) with radius 1/√2, which is about 0.707. The ellipse extends from x = -1/√2 to 1/√2, and y from -1 to 1. So, the circle is entirely inside the ellipse? Wait, no, because the circle is centered at (0,0) and has radius 1/√2, while the ellipse's semi-major axis is 1 along y, so the top and bottom points of the ellipse are at (0,1) and (0,-1), which are outside the circle. So, the circle is inside the ellipse in the y-direction, but in the x-direction, it reaches up to 1/√2, which is less than 1. So, it's actually tangent at two points on the x-axis, and also intersecting the ellipse elsewhere. But wait, the problem says it's tangent at two points on the x-axis. So, maybe the circle is tangent at two points on the x-axis, and intersects the ellipse elsewhere.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the circle \"lies tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis.\" Maybe \"lies\" here implies that the circle is entirely inside or outside? Hmm. Wait, but in our case, the circle is centered at the origin, so it's symmetric. Let me check the points of intersection. Let's see if the circle and ellipse have any other points in common.\n\nSet the equations equal: 2x² + y² = 1 and x² + y² = 1 - 1/k. Subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(2x² + y²) - (x² + y²) = 1 - (1 - 1/k)\n\nSimplify: x² = 1/k\n\nSo, x² = 1/k, which is the same as x = ±1/√k, which is the points of tangency on the x-axis. So, the only points of intersection are those two points. Therefore, the circle is tangent to the ellipse at exactly those two points on the x-axis, and intersects elsewhere.\n\nWait, but actually, when we subtract the equations, we get x² = 1/k, so that is the only solution. Therefore, the two curves only intersect at those two points, so the circle is tangent at those points. Since the system has only those two solutions, which are the points of tangency, that's okay. So, maybe that works. Therefore, k=2 is the solution. \n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"a circle which passes through F₁ and F₂ and which lies tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis.\" So, the foci are on the y-axis, so the circle passing through them must have its center on the y-axis (since the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the foci is the y-axis). Wait, the foci are on the y-axis, so the perpendicular bisector is the x-axis? Wait, actually, the line through the foci is the y-axis, so the perpendicular bisector is the x-axis. Hmm, so the center of the circle must lie on the x-axis? Wait, that can't be, because the foci are on the y-axis. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the perpendicular bisector of the segment between F₁(0,c) and F₂(0,-c) is the x-axis. Because the segment is along the y-axis, so the perpendicular bisector is the horizontal line through the midpoint (which is the origin). Wait, actually, the perpendicular bisector is the x-axis. Therefore, the center of any circle passing through F₁ and F₂ must lie on the x-axis? Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion that the center is on the y-axis? Wait, no. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the perpendicular bisector of the segment between F₁ and F₂ is the x-axis. So, any circle passing through F₁ and F₂ must have its center lying on the perpendicular bisector of F₁F₂, which is the x-axis. Therefore, the center of the circle must lie on the x-axis, not the y-axis. Wait, so my mistake was earlier when I assumed the center was on the y-axis. That was wrong. Because the perpendicular bisector is the x-axis. Hmm, so that changes things.\n\nSo, if the center is on the x-axis, then the circle's equation is x² + (y - h)² = r², where h is the x-coordinate of the center, and r is the radius. Since the circle passes through F₁(0, c) and F₂(0, -c), plugging in:\n\nFor F₁: (0 - h_x)^2 + (c - h_y)^2 = r². Wait, actually, I need to correct the coordinates. Wait, if the center is on the x-axis, then the center is (h, 0), right? Because the perpendicular bisector is the x-axis, so the center is (h,0). So, the center coordinates are (h,0), and radius r.\n\nSo, plugging in F₁(0, c):\n\n(0 - h)^2 + (c - 0)^2 = r² => h² + c² = r²\n\nSimilarly, plugging in F₂(0, -c):\n\n(0 - h)^2 + (-c - 0)^2 = r² => h² + c² = r²\n\nSo, same equation. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the circle equation is (x - h)^2 + y² = h² + c².\n\nWait, because r² = h² + c². So, the equation is (x - h)^2 + y² = h² + c².\n\nSimplify that:\n\nExpand (x - h)^2: x² - 2hx + h² + y² = h² + c²\n\nSimplify: x² - 2hx + y² = c²\n\nSo, the equation is x² - 2hx + y² = c².\n\nNow, this circle is tangent to the ellipse kx² + y² =1 at two points on the x-axis. Let's find those points. On the x-axis, y=0, so substitute y=0 into both equations.\n\nFor the ellipse: kx² =1 => x² =1/k => x=±1/√k\n\nFor the circle: x² - 2hx + 0 = c² => x² - 2hx = c²\n\nSo, x² - 2hx - c² =0\n\nThis quadratic equation must have exactly two solutions, which correspond to the points of tangency on the x-axis. Since the circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points, the quadratic equation x² - 2hx - c² =0 must have exactly two real solutions, and for tangency, the discriminant must be zero.\n\nWait, but actually, since the points of tangency are also on the ellipse, which gives x=±1/√k. So, the solutions to the circle equation at y=0 must coincide with the ellipse's points at y=0. Therefore, the quadratic equation x² - 2hx - c² =0 must have roots at x = ±1/√k. But since the ellipse has two points (±1/√k, 0), so the quadratic equation must have exactly those roots. Therefore, the quadratic equation can be written as (x - 1/√k)(x +1/√k)=0, which is x² - (1/k) =0. Wait, but that would be x² - (1/k)=0. Comparing with the quadratic from the circle equation: x² - 2hx - c² =0. Therefore:\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\nx² term: 1=1, okay.\n\nx term: -2h = 0? Because the quadratic from the ellipse at y=0 is x² - (1/k) =0, which has no x term. So, the coefficient of x in the circle's equation must be zero. Therefore, -2h =0 => h=0.\n\nSo, h=0. So, the center of the circle is at (0,0). So, the circle is centered at the origin. Therefore, the circle equation is x² + y² = h² + c² =0 + c²= c².\n\nBut c²=1 -1/k, so the circle equation is x² + y²=1 -1/k.\n\nWait, this is the same result as before, when I incorrectly thought the center was on the y-axis. But now, through proper analysis, even though I made a mistake in the first step, I came back and realized that the center is on the x-axis. But solving it correctly, it turned out h=0, so the center is at the origin, which is on both the x and y axes. So, the center is at the origin. Therefore, the circle is centered at (0,0), which is the same as the ellipse's center. So, the circle is concentric with the ellipse, but with a smaller radius.\n\nSo, proceeding with that, then the points of intersection are at x=±1/√k, and the circle equation gives x² +0=1 -1/k. Wait, but substituting y=0 into the circle equation, we get x² =1 -1/k. But from the ellipse, at y=0, x²=1/k. Therefore, in order for both equations to hold, 1/k must equal 1 -1/k. So, 1/k =1 -1/k, leading to 2/k=1, so k=2. Which is the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, despite my confusion about the center location, the answer is still k=2. But let me just confirm again with the tangency condition. To ensure that the circle and ellipse are tangent at those points, the gradients at the points of contact must be equal. Let's verify that.\n\nFirst, compute the derivatives at the points (±1/√k,0).\n\nFor the ellipse: kx² + y² =1. Differentiating both sides:\n\n2kx dx + 2y dy =0 => dy/dx = - (2kx)/(2y) = -kx/y. But at y=0, this is undefined. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, but the points are on the x-axis where y=0, so the derivative there would be vertical? Wait, actually, the ellipse at y=0 is at the endpoints of the minor axis, so the tangent lines there are vertical. Similarly, for the circle.\n\nFor the circle: x² + y² =1 -1/k. Differentiating:\n\n2x dx + 2y dy =0 => dy/dx = -x/y. Again, at y=0, the derivative is undefined, meaning vertical tangent lines. So, both the ellipse and the circle have vertical tangent lines at (±1/√k, 0), so their tangent lines are both vertical there, so they are indeed tangent. So the condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the value of k is indeed 2. So, the answer is 2, so boxed, \\boxed{2}\n\nWait, but just to make sure there's no other condition I missed. Let me check the entire system.\n\nThe circle is x² + y² =1 -1/k.\n\nThe ellipse is kx² + y²=1.\n\nWe found k=2, so ellipse becomes 2x² + y²=1, circle becomes x² + y²=1 -1/2=1/2.\n\nTo check if they are tangent, maybe we can solve them simultaneously. Let's subtract the circle equation from the ellipse equation:\n\n(2x² + y²) - (x² + y²) =1 - 1/2 => x² = 1/2.\n\nSo, x²=1/2, so x=±1/√2.\n\nSubstitute back into the circle equation:\n\n(1/√2)^2 + y²=1/2 => 1/2 + y²=1/2 => y²=0 => y=0.\n\nTherefore, the only points of intersection are (±1/√2, 0), which are exactly the points on the x-axis. Since substituting the two equations only gives those points, and at those points, the derivatives are both vertical, so they are tangent. Therefore, it's correct.\n\nSo, I think that's solid. Therefore, k=2 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2}\n</think>\n\nGiven the ellipse \\( kx^2 + y^2 = 1 \\), where \\( k > 1 \\), we need to find the value of \\( k \\) such that there is a circle passing through the foci \\( F_1 \\) and \\( F_2 \\) of the ellipse and which lies tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the ellipse equation in standard form:\n\\[ \\frac{x^2}{1/k} + \\frac{y^2}{1} = 1 \\]\nThis shows that the semi-major axis is 1 along the y-axis and the semi-minor axis is \\( \\sqrt{1/k} \\) along the x-axis.
