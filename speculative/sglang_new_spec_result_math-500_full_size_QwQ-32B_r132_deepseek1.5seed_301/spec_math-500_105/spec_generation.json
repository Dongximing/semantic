Hmm, let me start by recalling what a median is. The median is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers. If there's an even number of observations, it's the average of the two middle numbers. Since there are eight counties here, that's even, so I'll have to average the fourth and fifth numbers after sorting them.\n\nFirst, I think I should look at the 2005 column because that's what I'm supposed to find the median for. Let me list out the number of students per county for each county in 2005:\n\nAiken: 136  \nBamberg: 11  \nBarnwell: 29  \nBerkeley: 524  \nCalhoun: 11  \nCherokee: 19  \nChesterfield: 29  \nColleton: 41  \n\nAlright, so writing these down: 136, 11, 29, 524, 11, 19, 29, 41. Now, I need to arrange these numbers in order from smallest to largest. Let me write them out and sort them.\n\nStarting with the smallest: 11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524. Let me double-check that:\n\n- 11 is the smallest.\n- Next, another 11.\n- Then 19, which is next.\n- Then 29, and since there are two 29s, they both come after 19.\n- Then 41, which is next.\n- After that, 136.\n- Finally, the largest number is 524.\n\nSo, the sorted list is: 11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524.\n\nNow, since there are eight numbers, which is even, the median will be the average of the fourth and fifth numbers. Let's count them:\n\n1st: 11  \n2nd: 11  \n3rd: 19  \n4th: 29  \n5th: 29  \n6th: 41  \n7th: 136  \n8th: 524\n\nYes, so the fourth number is 29 and the fifth number is also 29. So, the median is the average of these two.\n\nCalculating the average: (29 + 29)/2 = 58/2 = 29.\n\nWait, so the median number of students in 2005 is 29? Let me just make sure I did that correctly.\n\nLooking back at the data:\n\nOriginal numbers in order: 11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524.\n\nMiddle positions for eight numbers: 4th and 5th. The fourth is 29 and fifth is 29, so their average is indeed 29. That seems straightforward. Hmm, but let me check if I transcribed the numbers correctly from the table. Maybe I made a mistake there?\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nAiken: 136 (2005) – correct.  \nBamberg: 11 – yes.  \nBarnwell: 29 – yes.  \nBerkeley: 524 – correct.  \nCalhoun: 11 – correct.  \nCherokee: 19 – right.  \nChesterfield: 29 – yes.  \nColleton: 41 – correct.  \n\nOkay, so all numbers are transcribed correctly. Then the sorted list is accurate. The median is 29. Wait, but hold on a second, is there a possibility that I miscounted the positions?\n\nLet me count the sorted numbers again:\n\n1: 11  \n2: 11  \n3: 19  \n4: 29  \n5: 29  \n6: 41  \n7: 136  \n8: 524  \n\nYes, so the fourth and fifth are both 29, so their average is 29. So the median is 29. \n\nHmm, that seems right. But let me think again: when there are eight numbers, the median is between the 4th and 5th. Since both are the same, the median is that number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the question says \"median number of students per county,\" but I think that's just the same as the median of the numbers in 2005. The question is phrased as \"median number of students in 2005,\" so yes, for each county's 2005 number, so the data set is the eight numbers. \n\nI think I did everything correctly. So, the median is 29. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if the question was asking for something else. Wait, the question says \"the median number of students in 2005,\" which is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's referring to the median across the years. So, since we have data for each county in 2005, the median is the middle value in that list.\n\nAlternatively, if it had said \"median number of students per year,\" then we might have to do something else, but no, the question specifically says \"in 2005\" so it's just the eight numbers from that year. \n\nOkay, so I think my answer is correct. The median is 29. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe median number of students in 2005 is \\boxed{29}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the median number of students in 2005 for the given eight counties, we first list the number of students per county for 2005:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{COUNTY} & \\textbf{$2001$} & \\textbf{$2002$} & \\textbf{$2003$} & \\textbf{$2004$} & \\textbf{$2005$} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Aiken} & 124 & 141 & 130 & 143 & 136 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Bamberg} & 17 & 15 & 15 & 14 & 11 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Barnwell} & 25 & 22 & 26 & 28 & 29 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Berkeley} & 583 & 557 & 554 & 553 & 524 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Calhoun} & 15 & 12 & 10 & 18 & 11 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Cherokee} & 19 & 13 & 18 & 13 & 19 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Chesterfield} & 46 & 18 & 13 & 22 & 29 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Colleton} & 64 & 49 & 52 & 46 & 41 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNext, we sort these numbers in ascending order:\n\n\\[\n11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524\n\\]\n\nSince there are 8 numbers, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th numbers. The 4th number is 29 and the 5th number is also 29. Therefore, the median is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{29 + 29}{2} = 29\n\\]\n\nThe median number of students in 2005 is \\boxed{29}.",
